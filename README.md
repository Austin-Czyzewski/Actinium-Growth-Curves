# Actinium-Growth-Curves
Irradiation calculations for actinium growth curves. Ongoing edits by myself and @gmclapp

The main script in this repository is the **Ac_growth_in_progress.py**
The other three necessary files are:
 - Beam data.csv
 - Target measurements.csv
 - Ac_growth_meta.txt

This set of programs is intended to help aide in the planning and execution of hitting R&D milestones
by providing a way for operators to input irradiation data and run a report that generates a graph
showing the prediction for the current production run.

It is also desirable to eventually be able to use this tool to plan production runs for either a 
required amount of actinium, or to determine production yield for a run of a specified time.
